# Inspirations or Captivating Interests, it all resides here.

We are a group of software engineering enthusiasts. We love collecting quotes that inspire us to do
good software engineering work or that pique our interests.

At the time of this writing for the first time, we are/were undergoing this course called 'Software Engineering' in our under-grad and we really enjoy(ed)
that subject. 

There is a lot to learn under this domain and the learnings here are not limited to software development domain
for wit and planned approach have prominence in all spheres of our life.

Hope we are able to collect all those quotes that may bring about a positive change in our readers(you). 

`Cheers`
